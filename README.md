<h3> 1. About It </h3>

<p>
This is the program that I made in my second year at college in order to practice two pointers, and algorithms. This program can be used for:
<ul>
<li> Sorting number (ascending order and descending order) and words (from A to Z and from Z to A) </li>
<li> Check if the word is palindrome or not </li>
<li> There is a guessing game entertainment, the program already has 10 numbers (from 1-100), the user just need to guess and see if the number is in the program or not. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> 2. How It Was Made? </h3>
<p>
The program is very simple to make and fun for practice. I use: 
<ul> 
<li> Selection sort algorithm to sort the numbers and words in order </li>
<li> Two pointers for palindrome checking 
<li> Binary search algorithm for the guessing game </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> 3. What I Learned? </h3>
<p>
I have learned tons of things new when doing this. I was quite new to the algorithm, but this help me understand better and improve my mindset logically. 
<ol>
<li> Multiple sorting algorithm and its complexity (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort). But in this case, simple sort as selection sort is more useful. </li>
<li> Two pointers technique across the arrays </li>
<li> Binary Search Algorithm. </li>
</p>
<h3> 4. Tools </h3> 
<p>
<ul> <li> Visual Studio </li> <li> .NET </li> </ul>
